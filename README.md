Kraton
======
Kraton is a modular code generation tool that may be used to generate code based
on type-safe templates written in Kotlin.

*Kraton is a forked version of the code generator previously used in
[Osmerion](https://github.com/TheMrMilchmann/Osmerion) which itself is a 
permutation of [LWJGL3](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3)'s generator.*

Supported Output
----------------
Kraton currently provides **just the Java language module**. Further languages
will be added in future updates.

Check out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TheMrMilchmann/Kraton/issues)
to see which languages are being worked on or to suggest a feature, or open a
pull-request to submit a feature yourself!
